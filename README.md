Simple GraphQL Golang Application to query movies and actors

**Project Overview:**

This project drew inspiration from Neo4j's movie dataset, resulting in the creation of three versions utilizing different databases: MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. 
The primary objective of this project is to implement GraphQL queries to interact with the databases, specifically retrieving information about movies, actors, and the relationships between actors and movies. 
The key focus is on determining which actor played a role in which movie.
